## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### 🔧 Backend – Render

1. Create a new Web Service
2. Connect your GitHub repository and choose /Backend
3. Set the *Build Command:* npm install
4. Set the *Start Command:* npm run dev or node server.js
5. Add Environment Variables:
   - MONGO_URI
   - PORT=8000
6. Deploy and note your backend URL (e.g., https://hostelhub-backend.onrender.com)

### 🧭 Frontend – Vercel or Render Static Site

#### Option 1: Deploy on Vercel
1. Import GitHub repo into Vercel
2. Set the root directory to Frontend/
3. Define Environment Variable:
   env
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
   
4. Build & deploy

#### Option 2: Deploy on Render (Static Site)
1. Create new Static Site
2. Choose /Frontend as the root
3. *Build command:* npm install && npm run build
4. *Publish directory:* dist
5. Add Environment Variable:
   env
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.onrender.com
   

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

### Frontend not getting data?
- Ensure VITE_API_URL is set before running npm run build
- Backend CORS must allow your frontend domain:
  javascript
  const cors = require('cors');
  app.use(cors({ origin: 'https://your-frontend.vercel.app' }));
  

### MongoDB not connecting on Render?
- Use a cloud-hosted MongoDB URI, not localhost
- Prefer MongoDB Atlas
